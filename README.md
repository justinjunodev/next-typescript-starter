### üöÄ Getting Started:

1. Clone and/ or download the project locally.
2. Navigate to the projects root directory and install its dependencies: `npm i`
3. Open `lib/metaFields` in your editor and update the default meta fields. _Note: this is an important step, as these fields are referenced in the `SEO` component, `useAnalytics` hook, and `next-sitemap`._
4. Rename the `.env.sample` file to `.env.local` and add your Fathom site id to the `NEXT_PUBLIC_FATHOM_SITE_ID` environment variable. You‚Äôll also need to add this environment variable to your project's deployment settings in Vercel (or wherever your project is hosted). _Note:_ _If you are not using Fathom analytics, you can delete the `hooks/useAnalytics` file and remove its invocation from `_app.tsx`._
5. You‚Äôre ready to code! Start your development environment `npm run dev` and build something awesome.
